### Battleships

Another classic game that I wanted to create in vanilla js.

I wanted to create it entirely in one script file, but it got too messy so I did eventually split it into files although still avoided using any build tools. The result is difficult to manage and I wouldn't try this again, but I leave it as an experiment.

Firebase was used for the socket connections.

Here it is: [Battleships](https://too-old-to-code.github.io/battleships/)
